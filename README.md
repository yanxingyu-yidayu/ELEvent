elevent abnormal detection system

The dataset is in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8043730.

The inconsistent sensor technologies of old-fashioned civil elevators (especially in old districts) have long hindered smart city construction, but these elevators usually have surveillance cameras to capture their condition. Since there has been a lack of publicly available datasets and detection methods for the detection of abnormal elevator events, we collected a novel dataset of elevator car surveillance videos from residential communities and proposed an elevator abnormal event detection system based on object detection models. The key object detection module(KOD) uses mainstream object detection models to detect important abnormal objects with their inference parts optimized. By using space-time logical judgment algorithms , the abnormal events classfication module (AEC) determines the occurrence of abnormal events. The experimental results indicate that our system can effectively detect abnormal events in elevator monitoring videos. We have also developed a visual prototype system to showcase our model and we believe our work can provide insights for our research community concerning anomaly detection in confined space.
